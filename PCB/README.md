AntMiner S1 PCB file.
EDA tool: Altium Designer 13.0

File List
 - ANT_Miner_V1.3.rar: hash board
 - ANT_Miner_CtrlBoard_V1.2.rar: control board
 - README.md


What is provided by Bitmain:
 - PCB file for ANTMINER S1 hash board
 - PCB file for ANTMINER S1 control board
 - Hex file for AR9331 module. We strongly recommended that you buy AR9331 module from Bitmain. Because the module is too complex, and it is not easy to produce it. In addition, there are different versions, we can¡¯t guarantee that our software suit for different version of AR9331 modules.
 - Hex file for PIC32MX250. You can buy PIC32MX250 from your local distributor or from us.

Flexibility
 - You can copy or refer to total hardware design of ANTMINER S1.
 - You can change the size of PCB and miner
 - You can change the chip frequency.
 - You can change the power design according to the miner¡¯s power.

Limitation
 - Only support 1 or 2 chains.
 - Total Hash rate can¡¯t be more than 120G per chain.
 - Software code of AR9331 and PIC32MX250 is not opened.

Future: We are designing a type of new control board based on ARM A8. When it is ready, the chain number can be up to 16, and the chip number can be up to 256 per chain.
